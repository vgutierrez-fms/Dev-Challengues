# Test development driven

# Introduction

This challenge is prepared to test your .NET and TDD skills, we mainly observe the following points:

- Analysis
- Coding best practices
  - OOP
  - Unit Test
- Programming language knowledge and experience.

# Functional Requeriments

- .NET Core
- Unit Test
- TDD

# Recomendations

- During the test, plan your tasks carefully in order to optimize your time. We recommend completing as many requirements as you can and focus first on the main ones and work on the optional/bonus requirements once you are happy with the implementation you have.
- Make sure you have uploaded your code to github before the test ends.
