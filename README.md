# Development Challengues

## Expectations

Select one of the specific challengues and send the instructions to the candidate. Recomend follow the instructions in the README files, once the candidate gets to a stopping point, they should commit and push the code and email a link to their repository.

### Time Allotment

We should respect the candidate's time and don't want they spending more 3 hours on a challenge (the challenges are scoped for ~1-1.5hr timeframe). We just want to get a sense of their thought process and development patterns. If there are features they don't have time to implement, use pseudo code is allowed to describe the intended behavior.

### Commit History

The candidate is free to choose the development workflow works best. If the solution is small enough and a single commit is justified, that's fine; we just ask that they keep their [commit history as coherent as possible](https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/codebase/dev/git/clean-commits/).

## What We will Review

The aspects of the interviewers' code we will judge include:

- **Clarity**: Does the README clearly explain the problem and solution?
- **Correctness**: Does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?
- **Testing**: If required - how thorough are the automated tests? Will they be difficult to change if the requirements of the application were to change?
- **UX**: Is the interface understandable and pleasing to use?
- **Technical Choices**: Choices of libraries, databases, architecture seem appropriate for the challenge?
