# Pycom iOS Challenge

## Introduction

This challenge is prepared to test your iOS architecture skills, we mainly observe the following points:

- Analysis
- Coding best practices
  - OOP
  - Unit Test
  - MVVM
  - Dependency Inversion
  - API Communication
- Programming language knowledge and experience.

Pycom Challenge is an app for showing [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com) pictures in a Collection View.
We've setup some boilerplate code for you ðŸ™‡ Your assignment is to improve the app and make it an enjoyable picture browsing experience.
We'll give you some tips, but the requirements and specification are quite open.

## Architecture

â€¢Â We would like you to use the MVVM architecture or an iteration of MVVM. Try to solve the problem of mixing business and presentation logic in the View Model

â€¢Â Support error scenarios by simply showing an alert view

â€¢Â Feel free to use any third-party libraries

## Requirements

â€¢Â The feed should be vertical, one picture per row

â€¢Â The app should cache the images so they're available when the app is offline

â€¢Â User should be able to tap the pictures in the feed to preview them in fullscreen

â€¢Â The app should show loading indicators when the feed is loading
