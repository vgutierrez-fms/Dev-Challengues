#React Native Todo App

## Requeriments

Modify the project to accept dynamic data from an outside source. The app can either spin up a
simple server with the hardcoded data or pull the data from any API(s) of your choice
(mockapi.io is a great tool for this). The data should include but is not limited to:

- A theme (colors, logos, font, text, etc.)
- A tagging filter, where tasks can be tagged and sorted by urgency (not urgent to urgent)

Download the project from:

https://github.com/gaguayo-jala/mobile-todo-app

## Tools and Language

- The project should be developed using React or React Native
- The storage layer should implement **Redux with toolkit.**

Feel free to also incorporate other libraries if you'd like, and go to beyond the requeriment to be creative with the task.
